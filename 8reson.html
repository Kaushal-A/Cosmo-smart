        <h1>8 fascinating facts about skin Care</h1>
      <pre>
        1) UV photos can reveal the sun damage simmering beneath your skin, 
        and the AAD has some photos that may shock you. Sun damage may not be 
        visible to the naked eye yet but will show up more with time. In addition 
        to using products with SPF daily, to slow and reverse these effects, she 
        recommends using a retinoid at night. Retinoids are skin-care products that can 
        help treat acne, combat early signs of aging, and help heal sun-damaged skin.

        2) Not only does your skin play a role in your immune function but it also acts as 
        a personal thermostat through a process known as thermoregulation. Sweating is a bodily 
        function that helps regulate your body temperature. Sweating isn’t your body’s only way of
        keeping you cool, though. When you’re especially warm, your skin helps cool you down via vasodilation. 
        Per research, vasodilation occurs when blood vessels just below the surface of the skin dilate, allowing for 
        increased blood flow and heat dissipation. Conversely, your skin can also help keep you warm when
        it’s cold outside, via the process of vasoconstriction. 

        3) When temperatures begin to dip in the winter, 
        harsh winds and indoor heating systems can suck the moisture right out of your skin. Having a 
        lizard like texture to your skin is one thing, but the issue doesn’t end there. “The skin needs 
        to be a healthier barrier to prevent infections. Dry skin is basically a cracked, broken barrier,” 
        Keep skin moisturized with products that contain hyaluronic acid, glycerin, or ceramides. Apply 
        these within the first minute of coming out of the shower when skin is still moist, which will 
        increase penetration and lock in hydration. 


        4) You clear dead cells away and keep your skin looking bright by exfoliating your skin regularly. 
        Opt for either a physical exfoliator, which physically clears dead skin cells and other impurities 
        from your skin, or a chemical exfoliator, which uses a mild acid to dissolve these dead cells. No need 
        to overdo it, though. It is recommended that people with sensitive skin exfoliate once a week, while people 
        with acne, combination skin, or oily skin should exfoliate twice a week

        5) Your skin can respond negatively to stress, just like your mind:
        Stress triggers a high level of cortisol and inflammatory molecules called 
        cytokines that spread throughout the body. This can lead to a rise in inflammatory 
        markers that trigger matrix metalloproteinases, enzymes that break down collagen molecules
        in skin. Developing a steady routine to deal with stress can go a long way in preserving your 
        skin health. Exercise is a proven way to manage stress also regular yoga routine is effective in reducing stress and anxiety .

        6)Changes in your skin can reflect underlying health issues
        Stress isn’t the only thing that can trigger a response from 
        your skin. Many conditions and infections can cause changes in your skin, whether they take the form of a rash, 
        hives, itching, redness, or swelling. An adult acne can occur due to fluctuating hormone levels, which could 
        indicate pregnancy, perimenopause, or menopause, but acne can also indicate a hormonal disorder such as polycystic 
        ovary syndrome. Skin disorders can be caused by a number of conditions as you age, including heart disease, diabetes, 
        liver disease, obesity, and nutritional deficiencies, to name just a few. 

        7)Thick skin serves a purpose
        Trouble spots on your skin may seem like an inconvenience, but they may have a reason for being. The bottoms of your 
        feet and heels may be made up of thicker skin (that you desperately try to get rid of via a pedicure), but that’s evolution 
        at work, protecting you while you walk. Elbows tend to get thicker over the years because we lean on them — it’s a reactive 
        response from the constant friction.

        
        8)Your skin would be happy with one product head to toe
        A quick trip to the skin-care aisle at your local drugstore and your head can get dizzy as you’re trying to choose between products 
        that address each area of the body. Certain conditions (such as acne), skin types, and preferences mean that you might reach for 
        different products for different areas — and that’s completely fine. But know that just because your skin does a big job, caring 
        for it doesn’t have to be complex. A daily routine is important, but it could just be cleanser and sunscreen in the morning and 
        cleansing and moisturizing at night.
